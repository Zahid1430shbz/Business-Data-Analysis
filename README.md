The Power BI dashboard presented earlier offered a multi-faceted view of super store sales data. Key graphical explanations include:

Sum of Boxes Shipped by Country (Bar Chart): This visualization clearly compared the shipping volume across different countries, highlighting Australia and Canada as primary destinations. The bar heights directly represented the quantity of boxes shipped, allowing for easy visual comparison of market activity.
Sum of Amount by Product (Line Chart): This line chart illustrated the revenue generated by each product. The steep decline from “Smooth Silk” indicated its dominance, while the gradual decrease highlighted the revenue contribution of other products. The trend line visually represented the product revenue hierarchy.

DASHBOARD — REVENUE SALES BY PRODUCT & COUNTRY-MONTH WISE
Monthly Wise Revenue (Pie Chart): The pie chart effectively showed the proportion of total revenue generated in each month. The varying slice sizes and associated percentages provided a clear understanding of seasonal revenue patterns, with April and June standing out as high-performing months.
Sales Person Given Revenue (Horizontal Bar Chart): This chart displayed the percentage standard deviation of revenue for each salesperson. The varying bar lengths visually represented the consistency of their sales performance, with Jan Morfoth showing the highest variability and Briein Boise the lowest. This highlights potential areas for performance management and best practice sharing.

Tableau Graphical Explanation:

The Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of super store sales data. Key graphical explanations include:

Sales Quantity (Horizontal Bar Chart):

Axis: The horizontal axis represents the “Sales Quantity.” The vertical axis lists “Category / Sub-Category.”
Bars: Each bar represents the total sales quantity for a specific sub-category, grouped under its main category (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology).

Insights:
Within Furniture, “Bookcases” have the highest sales quantity, significantly outperforming other furniture sub-categories.
For Office Supplies, “Binders” show the highest sales quantity. “Appliances” and “Supplies” also have notable sales.
In Technology, “Phones” have the highest sales quantity, followed by “Accessories.” “Machines” have the lowest sales quantity in this category.
Overall: This chart highlights which specific product sub-categories are driving the highest unit sales within each main category.

2. Maximum Profit by Category (Line Chart with Percentage Labels):

Axis: The horizontal axis lists “Sub-Category.” The vertical axis represents “Sales” (likely representing the profit amount in this context, given the title).
Lines and Points: Each line connects the profit values for different sub-categories. The percentage labels above each point indicate the percentage contribution of that sub-category’s profit to the total profit.

Insights:
“Copiers” have the highest maximum profit, contributing a significant 45.62% to the total.
“Chairs” also show a high maximum profit at 47.63%.
Several sub-categories like “Tables,” “Supplies,” and “Fasteners” have relatively low maximum profit contributions.
Overall: This chart identifies the most profitable product sub-categories and their relative importance in terms of profit generation.

3. Top 10 Sales Customer (Table):

Columns: The table displays information for the top 10 customers, including “Customer Name,” “Quantity” purchased, “Profit” generated, and “Sales” value.
Rows: Each row represents a unique customer, ordered by “Sales” in descending order (implied).

Insights:
Sanjit Chand is the top customer in terms of both “Profit” and “Sales.”
Keith Dawkins has a relatively high “Quantity” purchased but lower “Profit” and “Sales” compared to some others.
Tamara Chand, while not having the highest quantity, generates significant “Profit” and “Sales.”
Overall: This table identifies the most valuable customers based on their spending and profitability.

4. Profit & Loss by Customer (Map Visualization):

Geography: The map shows the United States, with states colored based on the “Profit & Loss” associated with customers in those regions.
Color Intensity: Deeper shades of blue likely indicate higher overall profit from customers in that state, while other colors (if present) might represent lower profit or losses.
Labels: Some states have labels with customer names, potentially indicating significant individual customers contributing to the profit/loss in those areas. For example, “Raymond Buch” is labeled in a state with a darker blue, suggesting high profit.

Insights:
The eastern part of the US appears to have states with higher customer profitability (deeper blue).
Individual high-profit customers are geographically located in specific states.
Overall: This map provides a geographical understanding of where the most profitable customers are located.

5. Best Category by State (Map Visualization):

Geography: The map of the United States is colored and labeled to show the “Best Category” (likely the category with the highest sales or profit) within each state.
Labels and Colors: Each state has a label indicating a numerical value associated with its best category. Different colors might represent different leading categories or ranges of values.

Insights:
California shows a high value (14,399) for its best category.
Texas also has a significant value (8,500) for its best category.
Smaller states have lower values for their best performing category.
Overall: This map highlights which states have the strongest performance in their leading product category.

6. Customer Segment State (Map Visualization):

Geography: The map of the United States is colored and labeled to show the distribution or size of a specific “Customer Segment” within each state.
Labels and Colors: Each state has a numerical label representing the count or value associated with the customer segment in that state. Different colors might represent different segment sizes or densities.

Insights:
California has the highest number (6,039) for this customer segment.
Texas also has a significant number (3,117).
Smaller states have lower numbers for this segment.
Overall: This map provides a geographical understanding of where the analyzed customer segment is most concentrated.

Conclusion:

Professional data analysis, powered by advanced technologies like Power BI and Tableau, is essential for extracting valuable insights from complex datasets. A structured learning experience, such as the 3-day course led by Professor Karim M. Rezaul, provides the necessary foundation in data analysis principles and hands-on skills with these powerful tools. The graphical explanations derived from both Power BI and Tableau dashboards demonstrate their capability in transforming raw data into easily understandable and actionable visualizations, ultimately supporting better business decisions. The ability to analyze sales quantity, revenue, customer behavior, and geographical trends through these platforms underscores their importance in modern business intelligence.
